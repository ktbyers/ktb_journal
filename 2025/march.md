# March

A journal of things I worked on, find interesting, and accomplished in March 2025.

#### _"I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo._ 

#### _"So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”_

I know that quote is cliche, but I still like it.

## High level

Most of this month was spent working on:
- My Ansible Course AI-RAG plus Slack system (more details below).
- Netmiko pull-requests and issues.
- In-person/Zoom training proposals and related contracts and quotes.
- Miscellaneous personal tasks (mostly taxes and house maintenance items)
- Life stuff—had a respitory illness which knocked me around for a few days and then had some lingering effects for another ~five days.

<br />

## AI Coding Items

I got back into serious work on my AI-RAG plus Slack question and answer system.

In March I worked on the following items for this system:
- Added support for direct Slack commands pertaining to file operations ("/file list", "/file list classN", "/file get filename.txt").
- Added associated tests for support of these Slack command operations.
- Added class8 transcripts using AI-whisper to generate the transcripts.
- Created a documented process for rebuilding my RAG system including adding the class8 transcripts.
- Added Python coverage and pytest-cov to improve Python test coverage reporting.

I am still using Cursor + Composer as my main AI coding system. 

_While I am a big AI-coding fan, at times, it feels like you are working with a dumb, forgetful assistant who doesn't pay much attention._ 

Although it is still amazing that you can view an AI coding assistant as a forgetful, not very intelligent person (basically AI has come an amazing distance in the last few years).

## Open Source Work (Netmiko / NAPALM / Nornir)

I did a bunch of work in the open-source world:
- Closed and categorized a bunch of old Netmiko issues—down to 119 open issues as of April 3, 2025. I know this is a lot, but it is a meaningful improvement from the end of February.
- Closed and reviewed a bunch of Netmiko and NAPALM pull-requests. I merged eleven Netmiko pull-requests and one napalm-ansible pull-request. I reviewed, provided feedback, and potentially made updates on several other pull-requests.
- Currently Netmiko has 19 open pull-requests. Once again this is a meaningful improvment from January/February.

## Exercise and My Crazy Running Addiction

Applied for the Dipsea 2025! Vamos!

I ran and cross-trained about 29 hours in March. I also had some sort of an illness that knocked me around for about five days (so there is a set of walking included in that 29 hours). This included about 125 miles of running and 11,400ft of elevation gain.

Unfortunately I had to DNS on the Big Alta 28K due to my illness. This was a bit of a bummer, but oh well.

My pick-of-the month runnning trail was a Muir Woods loop—Pantol to Muir Woods via Stapleveld-Ben Johnson Trails and then up Canopy Trail and back to Pantol via Matt Davis. That was a good loop:

## Favorite Family Board Game

My wife and I have been continuing our two-person Castles of Burgundy battles. She won the last one--that is not going to work.

## Courses and Misc

## Books

Mostly read Avogadro Corp about AI taking over. It was a good read, but not really believable. But I also probably run to the optimistic side on AI and human technology.
