# February

Journal of things I worked on and some other items I accomplished in February of 2025. Not, the best month in terms of productivity—oh well.

#### _"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity"_


## High level

There were several miscellaneous things that I worked on this month:
- New form of open-source sponsorship, education and support packages.
- Corporate training proposal.
- Tool implementation and testing for my AI-RAG Ansible Course Slackbot.
- Finished 2024 business taxes (good times).
- Numerous contributions to both Netmiko and NAPALM projects (more details below).


## Open-source Sponsorship / Education / Support Packages

For a long time I have realized that the open-source sponsorship model doesn't really work. This should not suprising at all—developers are basically saying I will do this work for free and holding out a tip jar.

At AutoCon2 in Denver I decided that I would try a new model whereby I could continue supporting Netmiko and Nornir, but (hopefully) receive better rumerartion for this. This also related a bit to being somewhat done with maintaining open-source and feeling I didn't do a good job on it in 2023 and 2024.

In February, I started reading a bunch of articles on developers that had been successful in funding the maintenance on open-source projects. From this I started to formalize what the new structure would be
## AI Coding Items

Testing on some of tool calling behavior. Adding list_files tool including tests. Adding class2 transcripts. Not a ton here.


## Internal Tools and Cost Reductions

## Courses and Misc

Started Netmiko course instance number9. Probably the last standard session of this course that I will run.

Started my free Learning Python for Network Engineers Course with about 1800 to 1900 sign-ups. Not sure what the main source of my sign-ups is.

Finished my 2024 business taxes.


## Open Source Work (Netmiko / NAPALM / Nornir)

Merged about 10 pull requests in the Netmiko project. Merged 1 pull request for napalm-ansible. Reviewed/merged two pull-requests for napalm. Merged a bunch of very minor dependency management pull-requests for NAPALM.

Convinced Juniper PyEZ to implement a fix for telnetlib and PyEZ (which was breaking PY3.13 support on both PyEZ and on NAPALM)


## Exercise and My Crazy Running Addiction

Ran about 124 miles in February with about 10,500 in elevation (roughly 18 runs and about 24 total hours running).

Roughly seven other workouts during the month (roughly 4.5 hours, exercise bike, treadmill, some weights).

Six days of skiing at Northstar.

Favorite running trail of the month—Dipsea Trail from Stinson Beach to Cardiac and back again. It is hard to beat running downhill through the Moors and heading into Stinson Beach.


## Favorite Family Board Game



## Favorite Song / Music
